Sentry helps you capture your React components and unlock additional insights in your application. You can set it up to use React component names instead of element names.

So instead of looking at generic names like this:

```
View > Touchable > View > Text
```

You can also see exactly which React component was used, like:

```html
MyCard (View, MyCard.ts) > MyButton (Touchable, MyCard.ts) > View > Text
```

After the capturing is enabled you can see the name of the component that was pressed in breadcrumbs and spans. This significantly decreases the amount of ambiguity involved in figuring out which element was interacted with as compared to trying to figure it out by looking at the generic element's name alone (which becomes even more ambiguous large the application is).

We're working to release more features that will leverage component name capturing in the future and highly recommended that you configure your project to use it.

## Prerequisites

- [Install](/platforms/react-native/) React Native SDK `5.25.0-alpha.3` or newer.
- Ensure React components you want to capture are in `.jsx` or `.tsx` files.

## Enable Component Names Capturing

Add the `@sentry/react-native/metro` plugin to your Metro configuration and enable the `reactComponentAnnotation` option.

```javascript {tabTitle:React Native} {filename:metro.config.js}
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("@react-native/metro-config");
const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/react-native/metro');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
module.exports = withSentryConfig(config, { annotateReactComponents: true });
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Expo} {filename:metro.config.js}
// const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { getSentryExpoConfig } = require("@sentry/react-native/metro");

// const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
const config = getSentryExpoConfig(config, { annotateReactComponents: true });
```

## How It Works

The Sentry React Native Metro plugin applies [`@sentry/babel-plugin-component-annotate`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/babel-plugin-component-annotate) which parses your application's JSX source code at build time, and adds additional `data` attributes onto it. These attributes then appear on the nodes of your application's built, indicating the React component name and file that each node is sourced from.

For example, if you had a component named `MyAwesomeComponent` in the file `myAwesomeComponent.jsx`:

```javascript
function MyAwesomeComponent() {
  return <Text>This is a really cool and awesome component!</Text>
}
```

After your bundler applied the plugin and built your project, the resulting node would look like this:

```html
<Text
  data-sentry-component="MyAwesomeComponent"
  data-sentry-source-file="myAwesomeComponent.jsx"
>
  This is a really cool and awesome component!
</Text>
```

The Sentry browser SDK will pick off the value from these `data` attributes and collect them when your components are interacted with.
